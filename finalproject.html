    	    		<img class="img2" src="elizabethblackwell.jpg" alt="Elizabeth Blackwell Portrait" width="150" height="150" />
    	    <p class="p4"> <b>Elizabeth Blackwell </b>was born on February 3rd, 1821 in Bristol, England. 
    	    Her parents were Samuel Blackwell, a sugar refiner, and Hannah
    	    Blackwell. She was the third of nine children. Elizabeth had a very
    	    happy, positive, and good upbringing, due especially to the loving
    	    influence of her father, Samuel. Blackwell's parents were extremely 
    	    progressive, meaning they worked for social change, more specifically,
    	    the end of slavery.</p>
    	    <p class="p4">In the beginning of her career, <b>Blackwell taught music at an 
    	    academy in Asheville, North Carolina,</b> so that she could save enough
    	    money to attend a medical institution. After this closed, she moved to 
    	    Charleston to teach at a boarding school. There, a college of her's attributed
    	    to the possibility of Blackwell attending medican school by sending letters to 
    	    institutions. After this unsuccessful attempt, she moved to Philadelphia and New York,
    	    hoping that she could find medical studies there.</p>
    	    <p class="p4">Once in Philadelphia, <b>she studied with Dr. Jonathan M. Allen </b> so that she was 
    	    able to get her food in the door at any medical institutions in the city. This 
    	    did not work, and many people told her to either disguise as a man or move to Paris. 
    	    This was because "she was a woman and therefore intellectually inferior" and 
    	    she might have been able to compete with the males already in medical studies, which
    	    was intimidating to them.</p>

    			<img class="img3" src="blackwellworking.jpg" alt="Elizabeth Blackwell Working" width="170" height="150" />
    	    <p class="p4">Finally, Blackwell was admitted into the <b>Geneva Medical College in New York </b>. Sadly,
    	    her acceptance was almost an accident, as she was admitted because the institution 
    	    thought that her application was a joke. The faculty of the college thought that Blackwell
    	    was <b>joking by applying, </b> so they allowed the medical students to decide if the college should
    	    admit her. The men assumed she was not serious about going to classes, so they voted for the
    	    school to let her in, but once they found out she was serious, they were completely shocked. 
    	    Blackwell went on to be the first women to receive a medical degree, she became a midwife, and then
    	    a speciality doctor for women and children. She is the pioneer for women in the medical field and ever
    	    since, she had been an idol to women aspiring to become doctors today!</p>
